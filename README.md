# DuckBands-Project1

## Project Name: Recording Duck Banding

## Introduction to the FDBB
Welcome to the website of the FDBB, which stands for the Federal Department of Bird Banding! The job of the FDBB is to band birds throughout the country, and record data on the sightings of such birds, tracking their movements for scientific research! If you are reading this, that means you have signed up as a new volunteer or employee! So welcome aboard! 

## The Mission of the FDBB
As a new member of the FDBB, you will use this SPA (Single Page Application) to record the following:
1) The banding of a new bird.
2) The sighting of a previously banded bird.
3) The death of a previously banded bird.

## Getting Started
To get started, start your json-server. This is done by typing "json-server --watch db.json" in your console terminal. Starting the json-server gives you access to the current data of banded birds. With this access, you will be able to add, update, or remove birds, depending on what has transpired. 

Next, open the `index.html` file in the browser. It is crucial to start the json-server first before opening the html file, otherwise you will have no access to the duck banded data.

## Information Needed
When approaching the application, please have some of the following information ready!
1) Band number, sub-species, image, and description of a newly banded bird!
2) Sighting of a new bird to add an increment.
3) Sad news of the passing of a bird, and ready to eliminate from the data set.

If you want to play around with the application first, here is some test data to use as a test!
Band Number: 1-Z
Sub-Scpecies: Green-Winged Teal
Image: 
Description: Just a test! But this is a super cool bird isnt it?

**MAKE SURE TO DELETE THIS BIRD ONCE YOU HAVE COMPLETED YOUR PRACTICE! DO NOT DELETE ANY OTHER BIRDS**
